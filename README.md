# Death and Texas

The idea here is to be able to scrape the info from the table at:

http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html

Hopefully, in the process, a kind a framework for scaping info from general HTML tables will be salvagable from this codebase.

Note so far: Using selenium for scraping the html is super ineficient. Research is pointing in the direction of Beautiful Soup. Hopefully that will result in something way quicker.
